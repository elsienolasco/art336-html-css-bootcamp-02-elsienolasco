        <h2>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h2>
        <p>Boy, was the<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>season two premiere intense! After everything that was thrown at us, we couldn’t help but come up with a few theories as to what we think is going to happen this season.</p>


<p>We would have started compiling our theories before the season premiere (or even after the season finale last May), but we felt like we really couldn’t come up with any. At the end of the first season, S.H.I.E.L.D. had been taken down and there were really no inclinations as to where the series would go next. In other words, there wasn’t much for us to theorize about besides the odds of Fitz’s survival <em>*sob*</em> and what’s going on with Skye’s newly discovered father.</p>

<p>So, we decided to hold off on coming up with theories until after we watched the <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> season premiere. And boy, do we have theories.</p>

<p>While our heads are buzzing with theories and potential “what ifs,” here are a few of our most promising ones.</p>
        
        <h3>Theories</h3>
        <ol>
        <dl>
            <dt>Season 2 will have a more cohesive plot.</dt>
                <!--Insert Image-->
                <p>Ok, so this may not be a wholly interesting theory, but it’s one we care about nonetheless. While we’re all pretty bummed that <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> was our last entry in the Marvel cinematic universe until<em>The Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> comes out in May, it may actually be a blessing for <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></p>

                <p>One of the biggest problems with season 1 was that the show had a hard time figuring out what it wanted to be. Some common criticisms of the show were that it had pacing problems and felt like it was jumping all over the place.</p>

                <p>Storylines that paralleled what was going on in the movies definitely didn’t help. Just when it felt like the plot was going somewhere, <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> had to work in Lady Sif, for example. While we love Lady Sif, we wish her appearance had more of a larger influence on the show’s narrative arc.</p>

                <p>Without having to fit in with the movies for the majority of the season, <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> can do the storytelling that it wants to do. And, from what we’ve gathered from the season premiere, the show is really taking advantage of that.</p>
            
            <dt>The Obelisk is an Infinity Stone.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
                <p>Sure, the Obelisk looks nothing like a stone (it actually looks like… well, a rectangular silver blob-ish thing) but the Infinity Stones that have been established in the Marvel Cinematic Universe seem to be interpreting the word rather loosely.</p>

                <p>Take <em>The Avengers</em>. The Tesseract, our first identified Infinity Stone, was a glowy cube. In <em>Thor: The Dark World</em>, the Aether was a weird, red, liquid-gaseous mess. Only the contents of <i>Guardians of the Galaxy’s</i> Orb looked remotely stone-like – and it was also all purple and fiery</p>

                <p>Resolved: An Infinity Stone can look like anything. So why do we think an Infinity Stone will be in play in <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> season 2?</p>

                <p>Three words: <em>Age. Of. Ultron.</em></p>

                <p>The second <em>Avengers</em> movie hits the US on May 1, 2015, which will sync up very closely with the conclusion of <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> season 2. This puts our plucky TV series in the perfect position to establish a massively powerful McGuffin – and then punt it over to the big screen for the Avengers to take care of.</p>

                <p>And when we say “massively powerful McGuffin,” we mean “Infinity Stone.”</p>

                <p>So! Which Infinity Stone do we think this silver squiggle is, exactly?</p>

                <p>Well, according to our literal neo-Nazi Dr. Whitehall, the Obelisk is believed to hold “the answer to death itself.” That seems weird at this point, because so far the weird silver thingamajig has caused nothing BUT death.</p>

                <p>But no less than the Red Skull himself was interested in this object – and we all know what the last otherworldly chatchka he was interested in was. If you don’t remember, it was the Tesseract, which – like we said – is also an Infinity Stone. (It’s cool, 2012 was a while ago.)</p>

                <p>Between this information, the fact that the Obelisk is important to Dr. Whitehall, <em>and</em> the revelation that the man <em>hasn’t aged</em> in <em>70 years</em> makes us think…</p>

                <p>Yeah, this thing is <em>definitely</em> the Time Stone.</p>

                <p>The scope of potential consequences of a freaking Infinity Stone on <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> is literally too vast to contemplate – especially if it has the power to alter history. But we will leave you with this one suggestion.</p>

                <p>Marvel’s <em>Agent Carter</em> is picking up steam. And wouldn’t it be nice if that 70-year information gap between Peggy and Director Coulson could just… go away for a while? Say, with the twist of an Obelisk?</p>

            <dt>Simmons is trying to find help for Fitz… and it may not end well.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
            
                <p>We’re not gonna lie, it was pretty darned devastating to learn that Simmons had left Team Coulson over the hiatus – and even worse to see the effect her absence had on Fitz. According to Coulson, Simmons thought that her leaving would help Fitz heal, but frankly, we find that a little hard to believe.</p>

                <p>(That’s code for, “This reasoning is utterly devoid of logic and makes no sense.”)</p>

                <p>So where <em>is</em> Agent Jemma Simmons, and what is she doing? While there’s always the possibility that Simmons just couldn’t handle her grief and guilt at Fitz’s reduced state (and seriously, we wouldn’t blame her – <em>we</em> can barely handle it, and <em>we know he’s fictional</em>) we have to suspect that the plucky biochemist has something else up her sleeve.</p>

                <p>Namely, trying to find something to fix our Fitz. That “something” might be last year’s mysterious miracle drug, GH-325. It might be the bizarre 0-8-4 which made such a splashy appearance in the season premiere. Or it might be something else entirely.</p>

                <p>But regardless of the details, we’re all but certain that Simmons is not content to let Fitz muddle his way through an incomplete recovery by himself.</p>

                <p>This likelihood opens up a whole new can of worms. Who is Simmons working for? What dangerous and amoral elements could she be getting involved with? (<em>coughAIMcough!</em>) And what will the consequences be?</p>

                <p>After all, this is the Marvel Universe. When was the last time anyone pursued a scientific panacea and everything wound up just about fine?</p>

                <p>Oh, that’s right! NEVER.</p>

            <dt>Lawless’ Hartley gets taken by HYDRA and they make her into the Winter Soldier 2.0.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
               
                <p>Let’s face it. Lucy Lawless is too much of a badass to hire on for just a single episode. For real though. If Marvel were to just let her die (and die like <em>that</em>), they’d have to be idiots. But they’re not idiots. That’s the thing. They’re smart and intuitive. They <em>knew</em> that everyone would be excited about seeing her on <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> and they wanted to use her badass reputation to their advantage.</p>

                <p>So, we postulate that, since she was able to withstand the effects of the Obelisk (which we previously theorized to be an Infinity Stone), that means that there’s something very special about her. Much more than meets the eye.</p>

                <p>As we saw, HYDRA is crawling all over the place and they have experience in implementing their technology or science in the bodies of innocents (Bucky and “the twins,” for instance). What’s to say that they won’t do the same to Isabelle Hartley, giving her an interesting storyline for the season? She could be a sort of anti-hero like Deathlok, but with a more pressing sense of duty and honor to S.H.I.E.L.D. (possibly more old S.H.I.E.L.D. than new).</p>

                <p>Plus, she actually tells Lance Hunter “You’ve seen what they can do with robotics these days” in an effort to persuade him to cut off her arm. Did nobody else get a vision of metal-armed Bucky right then?</p>

                <p>Could she even, perhaps, end up at the all-girls assassin school that Daniel Whitehall aka the Kraken (aka the bespectacled, young-looking HYDRA leader played by Reed Diamond) is known for running? It’s just a thought.</p>
            
            <dt>‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’ is going to go galactic.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
            <!--find link-->
            
                <p>So, if you caught a glimpse of what was inside the box that Dum Dum Dugan tried to open in the first few minutes of the season premiere, you may have noticed that it looks kind of like an arm. A bright blue, slightly muscular arm.</p>

                <p>More than that, it looks like a bright blue, slightly muscular arm with familiar symbols on it.</p>

                <p>Now where have we seen blue muscular bodies previously? Why, in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> of course! Ronan the Accuser, one of the film’s main villains, belongs to the Kree race. Yes, he was an extremist, but he was most definitely Kree.</p>

                <p>Theories had been floating around about the race of the strange alien on <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> with the Kree being one of the main theories. After their introduction into the MCU in <em>Guardians</em> we’re pretty sure that the alien that donated fluids to Coulson and Skye is, in fact, Kree.</p>

                <p>So what does this mean for the show? We think that it means that things are about to get weird. Weirder than they’ve been. The entire MCU is headed in the galactic direction, so it’s only natural that <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> would follow suit. It would make sense for the blue alien to be the show’s foray into the larger universe, especially if we’re right and the alien is of a race that we’ve already been introduced to.</p>

                <p>This could also mean that someone connected to Star-Lord and his crew could make an appearance on the show to translate the strange symbols that Coulson has been writing.</p>

                <p>As for what the essence of a Kree could really do to Coulson and Skye… Well, that’s a theory in progress. Kree are known to have super-human strength, especially on Earth, but need a higher concentration of nitrogen in the air in order to breathe comfortably. So there could be something there.</p>
    
            <dt>Peggy and/or Sharon Carter will make appearances on ‘S.H.I.E.L.D.’ to give guidance or rejoin the agency, respectively.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
                <p>Call it wishful thinking on our behalf, but we could really see this happening this season. Why?</p>

                <p>Well, first of all, Coulson is working to rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. Raise it from the ashes and give it a true, benevolent purpose again. Who better to consult than Peggy Carter? Sure HYDRA grew under her and Stark’s noses, but she could give helpful advice in other areas.</p>

                <p>Now, whether it’s old Peggy or recordings of a younger Peggy talking about her time building S.H.I.E.L.D. that makes an appearance on the show, we can’t say. But we could see either as a possibility.</p>

                <p>Secondly, <em>Agent Carter</em> is a go. What better way to promote the show than to have the show’s star in multiple guest spots on <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.?</em> It’s a pretty great idea, if we do say so ourselves. We can’t see Marvel passing up this opportunity.</p>

                <p>And, if all else fails and they don’t bring Peggy on, the next best thing to her would be Sharon. She had such an understated role in <em>The Winter Soldier</em> so we’d love to see more of her, even if it’s on the small screen. Peggy could definitely have passed on some wisdom or stories to Sharon at some point which could really come in handy for everyone.</p>
            
            <dt>Ward’s scruff is going to make him look hella good and Skye’s bangs are going to be bangin’ all season long.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
                <p>Seriously though. That beard and those bangs? Super intense. And awesome. Even Fitz’s hair looks a bit more suave somehow. Maybe season two of <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> will be like <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> in that it’s the part of the series where hair reigns over all.</p>
