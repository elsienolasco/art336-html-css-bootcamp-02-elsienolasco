        <h2>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h2>
        <p>Boy, was the<i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>season two premiere intense! After everything that was thrown at us, we couldn’t help but come up with a few theories as to what we think is going to happen this season.</p>


<p>We would have started compiling our theories before the season premiere (or even after the season finale last May), but we felt like we really couldn’t come up with any. At the end of the first season, S.H.I.E.L.D. had been taken down and there were really no inclinations as to where the series would go next. In other words, there wasn’t much for us to theorize about besides the odds of Fitz’s survival <em>*sob*</em> and what’s going on with Skye’s newly discovered father.</p>

<p>So, we decided to hold off on coming up with theories until after we watched the <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> season premiere. And boy, do we have theories.</p>

<p>While our heads are buzzing with theories and potential “what ifs,” here are a few of our most promising ones.</p>
        
        <h3>Theories</h3>
        <ol>
        <dl>
            <dt>Season 2 will have a more cohesive plot.</dt>
                <!--Insert Image-->
                <p>Ok, so this may not be a wholly interesting theory, but it’s one we care about nonetheless. While we’re all pretty bummed that <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> was our last entry in the Marvel cinematic universe until<em>The Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> comes out in May, it may actually be a blessing for <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></p>

                <p>One of the biggest problems with season 1 was that the show had a hard time figuring out what it wanted to be. Some common criticisms of the show were that it had pacing problems and felt like it was jumping all over the place.</p>

                <p>Storylines that paralleled what was going on in the movies definitely didn’t help. Just when it felt like the plot was going somewhere, <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> had to work in Lady Sif, for example. While we love Lady Sif, we wish her appearance had more of a larger influence on the show’s narrative arc.</p>

                <p>Without having to fit in with the movies for the majority of the season, <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> can do the storytelling that it wants to do. And, from what we’ve gathered from the season premiere, the show is really taking advantage of that.</p>
            
            <dt>The Obelisk is an Infinity Stone.</dt>
            <!--Insert Image-->
            <p>Sure, the Obelisk looks nothing like a stone (it actually looks like… well, a rectangular silver blob-ish thing) but the Infinity Stones that have been established in the Marvel Cinematic Universe seem to be interpreting the word rather loosely.</p>

            <p>Take <em>The Avengers</em>. The Tesseract, our first identified Infinity Stone, was a glowy cube. In <em>Thor: The Dark World</em>, the Aether was a weird, red, liquid-gaseous mess. Only the contents of <i>Guardians of the Galaxy’s</i> Orb looked remotely stone-like – and it was also all purple and fiery</p>

            <p>Resolved: An Infinity Stone can look like anything. So why do we think an Infinity Stone will be in play in <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> season 2?</p>

            <p>Three words: <em>Age. Of. Ultron.</em></p>

            <p>The second <em>Avengers</em> movie hits the US on May 1, 2015, which will sync up very closely with the conclusion of <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> season 2. This puts our plucky TV series in the perfect position to establish a massively powerful McGuffin – and then punt it over to the big screen for the Avengers to take care of.</p>

            <p>And when we say “massively powerful McGuffin,” we mean “Infinity Stone.”</p>

            <p>So! Which Infinity Stone do we think this silver squiggle is, exactly?</p>

            <p>Well, according to our literal neo-Nazi Dr. Whitehall, the Obelisk is believed to hold “the answer to death itself.” That seems weird at this point, because so far the weird silver thingamajig has caused nothing BUT death.</p>

            <p>But no less than the Red Skull himself was interested in this object – and we all know what the last otherworldly chatchka he was interested in was. If you don’t remember, it was the Tesseract, which – like we said – is also an Infinity Stone. (It’s cool, 2012 was a while ago.)</p>

            <p>Between this information, the fact that the Obelisk is important to Dr. Whitehall, <em>and</em> the revelation that the man <em>hasn’t aged</em> in <em>70 years</em> makes us think…</p>

            <p>Yeah, this thing is <em>definitely</em> the Time Stone.</p>

            <p>The scope of potential consequences of a freaking Infinity Stone on <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> is literally too vast to contemplate – especially if it has the power to alter history. But we will leave you with this one suggestion.</p>

            <p>Marvel’s <em>Agent Carter</em> is picking up steam. And wouldn’t it be nice if that 70-year information gap between Peggy and Director Coulson could just… go away for a while? Say, with the twist of an Obelisk?</p>

            <dt>Simmons is trying to find help for Fitz… and it may not end well.</dt>
